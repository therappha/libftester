## LibfTester

# Project still unfinished but its already available
for now it does not handle SIGSEV but it is a work in progress!

This is a test for 42school libft project, I plan to add more tests on the future, but for now its a work in progress.

## Usage
You can quickly set up and run the libft tester by using the following command in your libft folder.

```bash
# This command will download, execute and delete the test itself directly from the libft folder.
bash -c 'curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therappha/libftester/master/run.sh | bash'
